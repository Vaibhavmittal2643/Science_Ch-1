        Cell biology (also cellular biology or cytology) is a branch of biology that studies the structure, 
        function and behavior of cells. All living organisms are made of cells. A cell is the basic unit of 
        life that is responsible for the living and functioning of organisms. Cell biology is the study of structural 
        and functional units of cells. Cell biology encompasses both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells and has many 
        subtopics which may include the study of cell metabolism, cell communication, cell cycle, biochemistry, 
        and cell composition. The study of cells is performed using several microscopy techniques, cell culture, 
        and cell fractionation. These have allowed for and are currently being used for discoveries and research 
        pertaining to how cells function, ultimately giving insight into understanding larger 
        organisms. Knowing the components of cells and how cells work is fundamental to all biological sciences 
        while also being essential for research in biomedical fields such as cancer, and other diseases. Research 
        in cell biology is interconnected to other fields such as genetics, molecular genetics, molecular biology, 
        medical microbiology, immunology, and cytochemistry.

    <p>Some exsisit as unicellular organisms while others are a part of multicellular organisms. Certain basic functions like nutrition,respiration,growth,development
        are performed by the cells in all organisms.These functions are essential for the survival of the organisms.
        We therefore,regard the cell as basic structral and functional unit of all living organisms.
