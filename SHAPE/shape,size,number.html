        <h1>THE CELL</h1>
        <h2>Variation in Cell Number,Shape and Size in Living Organisms</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><h3>Cell Number</h3></li>
            <p>All organisms are of different sizes. This difference, in the size of the organisms, is due to 
                the number of the cells present in them. While amoeba is a living organisms consisting of a single
                 cell, an earthworm has millions of cells.
            </p>
            <li><h3>Cell Shape</h3></li>
            <p>
                The shapes of cell differ not only in different organisms but also in different organs
                of the same organisms They may be oval, spherical, cubodial, fibre-like polygonal. These difference
                 in shapes are due to their location and function in the tissue.For instance, a nerve cell has to
                  transmit nerve impulses to organs located in different parts of the body. Hence, they posses a long
                   fibre-like structure.

            <li><h3>Cell Size</h3></li>
            <p>Cell vary considerably in their size. The Smallest cell PPLO (PLEURO PNEUMONIA-LIKE ORGANISM),
                also called mycoplasma. is about 0.1 micron in diameter. The ostrich egg considered to be the largest
                 cell is nearly 170 mm in diameter.
