    <h1>Discovery of Cell</h1>
    <p id="p2">It was only after the advent of optical instruments,
        in the seventheeth century,that the cell was discovered and its basic features were discovered. </p>
        <p id="p2">Robert Hooke was the first scientist who, in 1665, observed thin slices of cork through his self designed
            microscope. He observed that they had honey comb like structures consisting of little compartments.
            It was later explained that these 'compartments' were actually dead cells bounded by a cell wall.
