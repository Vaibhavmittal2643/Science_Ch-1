            <p>All living cells are bounded by a membrane called plasma membrane,or the cell membrane.
                It surrounds its inner gel-like material called protoplam.
                The cells of plants,fungi and bacteria have an additional outer covering called the cell wall.
                The cell wall is an important covering in plant cells; it provides rigidity
                and protection to the cell against variation in the environment. It also gives a definite shape, 
                size and support to the cell.

            <li><h3>Cytoplasm</h3></li>
            <p id="pcytoplasm">The postion of the protoplam lying inner to the cell membrane but 
                outside the nuclear membrane, is called cytoplasm. It acts a ground substance for all cell activities.
            It is made up of carbohydrates, proteins,fats,minerals and vitamins,along with a large proportion of water.
            All these components work together to provide a unique living nature to the proplasm.
            </p>
            
            <li><h3 id="nucleus">Nucleus</h3></li>
            <p id="pnucleus">It is the most important part of the cell. It is generally 
                located in the centre of the cell.It controls all the activities of the cell.
                The nucleus id a dense structure bounded by a Nuclear membrane.
                The protoplasm of the nucleus is called nucleoplasm. It has a thread-like network
                called chromatin. When the cell is ready to divide, this 
                chromatin condenses to form thicker, thread-like structures, called chromosomes.
                These chromosomes are the structures responsible for the chracters (genes) inherited
                 by one generation from the earlier generations.
