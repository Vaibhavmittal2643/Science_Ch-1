        <h1>Comparision between Plant Cell and Animal Cell</h1> 
        <br><br>
        <p>Plant cell generally have a definite shape due to a rigid cell wall around them.
            In comparision, animal cells have a cell membrane as their outer cover. This provides 
            flexiblity to animal cells; hence they can show a large variation in their shapes.
            Moreover plant cells have plastids; these are absent in animal cells. Plant cells 
            generally have large vacuoles; animal cells, on the other hand, either lack vacuoles, or have very small vacuoles.
